        "content": {"rendered": "<p>IPN Spotlight: Dr. Zohray Talib (Associate Professor of Medicine &amp; Health Policy, George Washington University)<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Zohray Talib is Associate Professor of Medicine and of Health Policy at the George Washington University in Washington, D.C. She practices Internal Medicine and is a leader in global health with expertise in health workforce, community engagement and medical education. Dr. Talib is a Member of the National Academy of Science Global Forum of Health Professions Education and currently serves as the Honorary Secretary of the Aga Khan Health Board for the USA. She has worked with leadership of medical schools in Africa to improve the quality of their education programs. She currently leads a study across ten countries examining the value of bringing students and academic rigor to community health facilities. Dr. Talib has consulted for programs in Central Asia and Africa and has published on different aspects of building capacity within health system in low-resource settings. Dr. Talib received her B.Sc. in Physical Therapy from McGill University and her M.D. from the University of Alberta.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What skills have helped you in your career?<\/strong><br \/>\nBeing able to develop my career in multiple dimensions simultaneously &#8211; as a clinician, as an educator, as a program director, and as a global health researcher.<br \/>\nBalancing the urgent daily tasks, while also investing regularly in a longer-term goal and keeping my eye on the ball of what contribution I would like to make.<br \/>\nAs a mom of three kids, the balancing act can get complex so I have embraced creative ways of managing at home including scheduling meals in advance, shopping online for groceries and getting the kids involved in housework.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you wish you had known or done differently throughout your career?<\/strong><br \/>\nThere were times during residency training that I could not see the light at the end of the tunnel. The days seemed long and I was not able to nurture any other part of my career path. At those times, I needed reminders that it is important to embrace certain phases of learning and dive deep in skill-building. In hindsight it is much easier to appreciate the value of having immersed myself in clinical training for that time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is next for you in your career?<\/strong><br \/>\nI would like to continue to strengthen the academic health sector in low-resource settings. I feel strongly that strong academic institutions can underpin and sustain development. Strengthening academia will require diversifying partnerships (e.g. to include the private sector) and innovative thinking on how we teach and evaluate education programs. I would like to continue to build the evidence and advocate for decentralizing academia. Bringing academic rigor and resources to low-resource communities and under-served areas creates a vibrant environment where there is synergy and efficiency between teaching, learning, service and research.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you do for continuing education and improvement?<\/strong><br \/>\nI am constantly learning. I am an ad hoc reviewer for several medical journals which is a way to keep abreast of what is happening in my field of work. My research and teaching roles require me to read the literature regularly and I often read about the conditions my patients have. Like many others, I also watch TED talks and enjoy reading articles on social media.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What advice would you offer to others?<\/strong><br \/>\nAllow for creative paths to achieve your career goals &#8211; don&#8217;t assume just because you can&#8217;t see the path that there isn&#8217;t one. Career paths are rarely linear. New doors often open at unpredictable times, so allow for that while working diligently towards the goals you set. Work hard and smart but also seek mentors to guide you in different aspects of your career. It is very uncommon to find one mentor who can advise on everything and often it takes time, effort and patience to find the right mentor. Be bold and ask those you admire if they can guide you on your path.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Areas where you can help other Ismailis:<\/strong><br \/>\n\u2022Mentoring professionals interested in global public health<br \/>\n\u2022Finding opportunities to get involved in our community service<br \/>\n\u2022Monitoring and evaluation<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/ZohrayTalib\" target=\"_blank\">Connect with Zohray<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/98.221.94.247\/wordpress\/ipn-spotlight-nomination\/\">Nominate someone for an IPN Spotlight<\/a><\/p>\n"},

Venture Lab is a seed-stage impact investor that provides capital and support to early-stage startups that leverage technology to increase access to financial services for the under-served globally. She previously led strategic projects at LeapFrog Investments, an emerging market private equity fund. Prior to that, Tahira worked as Director of Strategy at the Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development. Based in Dubai, she drove strategic initiatives for the portfolio and led new investments in telecoms, technology and infrastructure in South\/Central Asia. She also worked at Roshan, Afghanistan\u2019s leading telecoms operator, where she was Head of Corporate Strategy. Tahira began her career as a management consultant with Bain &amp; Company in Boston. She holds an MBA from INSEAD and BAs in International Relations, Computer Science, and Education from Brown University.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What skills have helped you in your career?<\/strong><br \/>\nThere are various sets of soft and hard skills that have helped me in my career. Through my experience in management consulting, I built a strong toolkit of strategic and analytic skills. Those were further honed through my time in Afghanistan with Roshan. I also got the opportunity to build a series of management skills as I worked with a team of Afghan and expat staff. Problem solving, partnership building, and leadership skills have also been critical as I&#8217;ve navigated through my career.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is next for you in your career?<\/strong><br \/>\nI currently work in the impact investing space where I look to make investments in companies that will generate strong financial returns and also have a significant social impact. The idea of eliminating trade-offs between financial and social returns is a big driver for me. If we can demonstrate that impact isn&#8217;t generated at the expense of financial returns, we can open the gates of the capital markets to social enterprises and other impact-focused businesses. I&#8217;m excited to continue driving forward this vision.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What advice would you offer to others?<\/strong><br \/>\nAllow yourself to be opportunistic and to take advantage of the things that come your way. It&#8217;s great to have a plan, but there&#8217;s also a lot of value in letting yourself deviate from that plan when unique opportunities come along. Make sure you put yourself in environments that challenge you and push you beyond your comfort zones. Seek out not only good roles but also good managers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you do for continuing education and improvement?<\/strong><br \/>\nAs a lifelong lover of books, I&#8217;m always reading. Be it fiction or non-fiction, reading has always given me insights into the world in addition to exposure to new ideas and content. I also get to travel extensively for work, which ensures that I&#8217;m experiencing new places and learning from my changing environments.
